# Fresh-laravel-installer v1.0 Stable
#this is a bash command which is kind of time saver for laravel developers and heaven command who are/ is starting developing laravel but confused about how to install this and how this works.
NOTE: <b>KEEP IT IN YOUR MIND THAT PHP MCRYPT IS INSTALLED ELSE YOU NEED TO INSTALL AND ACTIVATE IT BECAUSE LARAVEL 4 USE PHP MCRYPT.
1.<b>open your terminal and type sudo -i  <br/>
2. then it will ask you for your system passowrd put that and become sudo user <br>
3. after that download code from this repo <br>
4. change your directory where yu have just downloaded the file using cd /<your path to directory> to locate the file completely <br>
5. give permission to Laravel.sh file using <red>sudo chmod -R 700 Laravel.sh</red> (optional).<br>
6. now the final step write <h1>./Laravel.sh</h1> <br>
7. and it will ask you which version of laravel u wana install input it through out the process it might ask you two times for the laravel version and the folder name though and after that u will get ur laravel installed.
